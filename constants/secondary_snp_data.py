Now does being a FUT2 non secretor help you?<br/><br/>
Well we now know that FUT2 non secretors have more issues with bacteria and
less issues with certain viruses.<br/><br/>
So here is a little something about FUT2 showing that non secretors may have
some protection against certain viruses. A few of my FB followers shared this
information with me. I would encourage anyone who would like to know more
about FUT2 to follow the FUT2 non secretor group on FB<br/><br/>
Being a non-secretor seems to offer some protection against viruses. I’ve come
across the following (caps for emphasis):<br/><br/>
For example, NON-SECRETORS HAVE REDUCED INCIDENCE OF influenza
A, influenza B, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections,23 but
increased incidence of Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae24 and
Candida albicans25 infections, compared with secretors. In relation to chronic
respiratory conditions, non-secretor asthma patients present with fewer
exacerbations26 and non-secretor cystic fibrosis patients (with severe impairment
of lung function) have prolonged time until P. aeruginosa colonisation;27
however, non-secretors with COPD have a lower FEV1%.28
https://thorax.bmj.com/…/08/thoraxjnl-2016-208775.full.pdf<br/><br/>
*******<br/>
Individuals homozygous for the FUT2 NONSECRETOR GENOTYPE APPEAR
TO BE RESISTANT TO INFECTION WITH NOROVIRUS9, suggesting that
individuals homozygous for nonsecretor status may be unable to mediate hostmicrobe interactions9.<br/><br/>
*******<br/>
Also:<br/>
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), an RNA virus. The original SARS outbreak in the winter of 2002
to 2003 infected >8,000 individuals worldwide, with a fatality rate of 10% (292).
Like other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV infects the mucosal epithelium,
causing an acute respiratory illness often accompanied by gastroenteritis. In a
Hong Kong outbreak, there was an apparent association between disease
transmission and ABO type (293). An epidemiology study of 34/45 hospital
workers who contracted SARS after exposure to a single index patient showed
that most of the infected individuals (23/34) were non-group O individuals
(groups A, B, and AB). Group O individuals were relatively resistant to infection,
with an OR of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.81; P = 0.03).<br/><br/>
LIKE HIV, CORONAVIRUS IS AN ENVELOPED VIRUS THAT TARGETS
HOST CELLS VIA A VIRAL ADHESION GLYCOPROTEIN. The SARS-CoV
spike (S) protein is a 210- to 230-kDa glycoprotein with 23 potential Nglycosylation sites (292). Glycan analysis shows a wide range of structures,
including complex N-glycans with 2 to 4 antennae capable of supporting ABH
epitopes (292, 294). Because the virus targets respiratory and gastrointestinal
mucosa, it is highly likely that most human isolates express ABH antigens on the
S protein and host envelope GSLs. Like the Env protein, S protein expressing A
antigen can be blocked by monoclonal anti-A and human anti-A (292).<br/>
*******<br/>
Nonsecretor status is associated with a decreased risk of several respiratory viral
infections. By use of molecular genotyping, 2 populations of Senegalese women
were examined for polymorphisms of the FUT2 gene. Among Senegalese
commercial sex workers, absence of FUT2 (NONSECRETOR GENOTYPE)
WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED RISK OF HUMAN
IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).<br/>
********<br/>
Because various bacteria and viruses use attachment to cells as a means of
causing infections, it has been determined that some NONSECRETORS have
been found to have increased bacterial infections, but a DECREASED RISK IN
RESPIRATORY AND GASTROINTESTINAL VIRAL INFECTIONS. Recent
data from a study by Ali Suleman, et al1indicates that absence of this enzyme
